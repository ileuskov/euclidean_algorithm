Hello there! This is my small pet project to find the greatest common divisor of 2 numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
I learned this algorithm at my university and really wanted to implement it using java. 
I have made 2 versions of it: a simpler one that manually checks the numbers in the loop and the more advanced one that uses the recursion

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
