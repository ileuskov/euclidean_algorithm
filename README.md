Hello there! This is my small pet project to find the greatest common divisor of 2 numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.<br>
<br>
I learned this algorithm at my university and really wanted to implement it using java. I have made 2 versions of it: 
<br> 1) a simpler one that manually checks the numbers in the loop and <br> 2) the more advanced one that uses the recursion <br>
<br>
Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
